<p>I've recently been playing around with the <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/" target="_blank">WebRTC</a> (web real-time communication) stack, in particular <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/" target="_blank">getUserMedia</a> which grants you access to the webcam and mic in javascript. In particular I've put together an alpha of a motion control library that allows the user to swipe their hand and have the webpage respond. More details can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/pci/mocap_js" target="_blank">github page</a>, but it makes more sense just to try the demo:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://pci.github.com/mocap_js/demo/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-231" title="Screen Shot of demo gallery" src="{{ site.url }}/images/old_blog/Screen-Shot-2012-08-01-at-17.38.55-1024x563.png" alt="" width="550" height="302" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://pci.github.com/mocap_js/demo/" target="_blank">Demo</a> - works in chrome and firefox nightly (at the time of writing)</p>
<p>The library is currently in its infancy but I'm planning to add auto-calibration and other niceties as time goes on. If it doesn't work for you, please let me know in the comments.</p>
