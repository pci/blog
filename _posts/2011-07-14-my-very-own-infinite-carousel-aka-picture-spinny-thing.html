<p>After a conversation with a friend, I set about making a non-flash carousel because, you know, I'm cool and that..... Then after making it I needed to store it somewhere, so here it is! All-told about 2 hours work, with pictures stolen from my church's <a title="Grace Church Nottingham" href="http://gracechurchnottingham.org" target="_blank">website</a>, mainly because the graphics team there are simply amazing.</p>
<p>You might ask why not use flash, after all I'm not against flash. But in this case there are two main reasons why you might try a non-flash solution:<br />
- So it can work on the iPhone/iPad<br />
- Because screen readers (for the partially sighted/blind) can't read flash sections of a webpage but, conversely, any html present can clue the reader into what's going on semantically within a page.</p>

<p>Geek notes: the glow effect is CSS3 box-shadow (learn more <a href="http://blog.gesteves.com/post/475773360/css-glow-effects-with-box-shadow" target="_blank">here</a>), IE6-8 support is added with <a href="http://css3pie.com/" target="_blank">CSS3Pie</a></p>
