<p><strong>Note: I'll be updating this as I go</strong></p>
<p>Got some blatantly rubbish spam the other day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From: XXX@ifsertao-pe.edu.br<br />
Date: 14 March 2011 11:54<br />
Subject: Notification</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You Have Won The EuroMillions Lottery<br />
Contact: Edward Louis via Email: <a href="mailto:donotreply@live.com" target="_blank">euro-millions16@live.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>************</p>
<p>How little effort! (The X's being added by me to give the guy with the hacked account some privacy). So I decided to reply.<!--more--></p>
<p>A couple of points to note on the first email:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was very short, presumably to give the spam filter less to work with</li>
<li>It pushs you to reply to a different email address, this means that spam filters won't block the contact with the spammer (at the live.com address) because you initiate the conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I was curious to see how deep the rabbit holes goes....</p>

<p>Anyone else notice that 3*1,593,000 = 4,779,000 not 4,528,000? But it's an error in my favour so I carry on regardless, and start:</p>

<p>By this point it's turned out the emails are coming from Nigeria, so the phone number given (A premium rate one at that) probably doesn't connect to Mr Moore. Working on this fact:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dear Mr Moore,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I would rather give my details over the phone than  over email as I've heard bad things can happen. I tried to phone you on  Saturday, but it being the weekend there was no answer. Is there a good  time for me to phone you?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thank you,<br />
J Grant</p>

<p>And with that Mr Moore and his associates stopped replying. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted!</p>
