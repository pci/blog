<p>Here's the <a title="Ray Optics Demo" href="http://hacks.philingrey.com/ray/" target="_blank">ray optics demonstration</a> I made during my PhD. It models ray-surface interactions in javascript... and that's pretty much it! But it's still quite a fun way to waste 5 mins. Any modern browser should be able to run it*.</p>
