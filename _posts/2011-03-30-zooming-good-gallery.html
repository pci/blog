<p>I'll admit that I'm slightly obsessed with <a href="http://janne.aukia.com/zoomooz/">zoomooz.js</a>, it's a cross-browser (excluding IE) nice zoom plugin for jQuery. And although it has some issues with scrolling it's a top-notch plugin in my books. To showcase it's greatness I made a mock-up of a picture gallery*:</p>
<p><a title="Zooming-Good-Gallery" href="http://hacks.philingrey.com/ZGG/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-38" title="ZGG" src="assets/Screen-shot-2011-03-24-at-18.47.28-300x168.png" alt="" width="341" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>*if any of the pictures are yours let me know and I'll acknowledge you here.</p>
<p>The polaroid effect is CSS based, with a bit of javascript to fit the pictures. The random distribution uses CSS3 <a title="CSS3 Transforms" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/css/using_css_transforms" target="_blank">transforms</a> (random rotation with a slight translation). ZooMooz.js then does the rest!</p>
<p><strong>Geek Bootnote</strong>: The page uses @font-face and html5 data attributes to keep track of the ordering, the juicy javascript can be found <a title="data-attribute and zooing script" href="http://hacks.philingrey.com/ZGG/js/script.js">here</a> (script.js)</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A good intro on Zoomooz.js can be found <a title="Intro to Zoomooz.js" href="http://designshack.co.uk/articles/javascript/create-an-awesome-zooming-web-page-with-jquery/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
